Timeline

My final submission
deleted repositories by mistake grrrrr no rest for the wicked
database acting up, mongo and node an exciting topic i will enjoy, looks fancy too
login page works but not connecting with dbase
Group1 has been stable for over a month, must be getting the hang of this and doing it right
repositories not in use about to get the chop
rgu repository okayish, coding in there is all mumbled, but it works, just not great. Will keep this as backup incase Group1 acts up
Bootstrap bootstrapping rgu repository but still works, backup suddenly appealing
Group1 repository tidier determined to make it work, simple but flawless
